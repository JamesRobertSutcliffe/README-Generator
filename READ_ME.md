# ReadMe Generator
  ![Github license] (https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

### Description

The Project is my first dive into the backend using node.js. It was interesting to finally have a look at what goes on 'under the hood' of a project and step away from the front end for a while. The project has a useful real world usecase for programmers, making it easy to create professional ReadMe's using the console. I am actually creating this ReadMe using the tool! In creating this project I began to understand how the backend is utilised and learned the use of node.js and npm for installing various backend softwares such as inquirer.
